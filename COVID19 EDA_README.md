# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Exploration & Visualization Project

## 📌 Overview

This project involves in-depth exploration of global COVID-19 data using SQL to uncover trends, relationships, and key insights. The cleaned and analyzed data was then visualized using
**Tableau** to provide an interactive and insightful dashboard for better understanding of the pandemic's impact.

## 🔧 Tools Used

* **SQL Server** – Data Cleaning, Aggregation & Analysis
* **Tableau** – Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation
* **Microsoft Excel** – Initial Data Handling and Exporting

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used contains COVID-19 cases, deaths, population data, and vaccination statistics across various countries and dates.

## 🔍 Key SQL Tasks Performed

* Identified global trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations
* Calculated death percentages and infection rates by country
* Used CTEs, Temp Tables, and Window Functions for efficient querying
* Joined multiple tables to enrich insights
* Cleaned and prepared the data for visualization

## 📊 Tableau Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was created in Tableau featuring:

* Global Cases vs Deaths
* Country-level Vaccination Progress
* Rolling Averages of Cases & Deaths
* Infection Rate by Population
